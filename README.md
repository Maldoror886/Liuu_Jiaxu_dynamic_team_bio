# Liuu_Jiaxu_dynamic_team_bio

## Assignment Requirements:

Design a bio page! Consider this a page in the context of a larger studio site - look at how “real”
design / dev houses do this, and come up with your own style.

Only one team member’s information should be visible at a time; you’ll provide some way to
click and view each member’s information on demand.

Create an array to hold bio information (text) for each team member. Each team member is

responsible for populating this array with text - add your own! You’ll be retrieving this text on a
click or other event, and putting it into a paragraph tag (or multiple tags) on the page.

You will also include a headline for the team member’s name that will change based on
whose info is currently active.

Include an image tag that switches its source based on the team member you’re viewing
(head shot or something similar).


## Artworks:
The designer used two circular containers to put pictures and two buttons below the pictures. The interviewer needs to click on the buttons to see the information of each person. Taking the pattern of buttons adds interactivity to the web page.

## JS:
1.Use manArray, and addEventListener to show JS.
2. Button function: addEventListener to click button.
